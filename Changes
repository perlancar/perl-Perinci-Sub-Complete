Revision history for Perinci-Sub-Complete

0.64    2014-11-28 (PERLANCAR)

	- Adjust to Complete 0.04 (in hash form, words are now put in
	  'words' instead of 'completion').


0.63     2014-09-03 (PERLANCAR)

         - Use ignore_converted_code option to keep tab completion working when
           there is coderef cmdline_aliases property.


0.62     2014-08-06 (SHARYANTO)

         - [Bugfix] When producing 'args' by calling get_args_from_argv(),
           forgot to set strict => 0.


0.61     2014-08-06 (SHARYANTO)

         - Provide 'words', 'cword', 'args' in 'extras' passed to completion
           routines.


0.60     2014-07-27 (SHARYANTO)

         - Now uses Complete::Getopt::Long instead of implementing completion
           logic ourselves. The code is now much shorter and completion is now
           more proper, fixing some deficiencies, e.g. inability to expect
           option value for common option (like '--format=s' used by
           Perinci::CmdLine).

         [REMOVED FEATURES]

         - To simplify code, remove argument 'custom_arg_completer' and
           'custom_arg_element_completer', because 'custom_completer' (now
           'completion') can assume the task.

         - To be more generic, rename argument 'extra_completer_args' to
           'extras'.

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - To be more consistent with naming of completion routine in other
           modules, rename argument from 'custom_completer' to 'completion'. It
           must only be a coderef instead of coderef or hash of coderefs. Some
           of the arguments it receives also change.

         - To simplify code, no longer does parse_cmdline() when 'words' and
           'cword' is not defined. Instead, now the args are required and you
           need to parse cmdline yourself.


0.59     2014-07-25 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes.

         - Adjust to Complete::Bash 0.09.


0.58     2014-07-24 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes.

         - Some minor updates to tests.

         - Use Data::Sah::Normalize instead of Data::Sah, to reduce deps.


0.57     2014-07-19 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes.

         - Adjust to Complete::Bash 0.06.


0.56     2014-07-18 (SHARYANTO)

         - [Bugfix] Excluded the option we're trying to complete ('cmd --help^'
           or 'cmd -h^' didn't work because we excluded that option from the
           list!).


0.55     2014-07-18 (SHARYANTO)

         - Adjust to Perinci::Sub::GetArgs::Argv 0.44, which makes it more
           convenient for us to do completion (get_args_from_argv() returns the
           result from gen_getopt_long_spec_from_meta(), which contains all
           sorts of goodies ready for use, like func.opts_by_arg,
           func.opts_by_common, etc.

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - To make it easy to work with the new get_args_from_argv(),
           'common_opts' has been changed to be in the same format that that
           function expects, which is a hash of Getopt::Long opt spec &
           handlers.


0.54     2014-07-18 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes.

         - Adjust to Complete::Bash 0.04.


0.53     2014-07-02 (SHARYANTO)

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Rename function shell_complete_arg() to complete_cli_arg() for
           consistency (all completion routine now uses /^complete_/).


0.52     2014-07-02 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes.

         - Adjust to Complete::Util 0.12.


0.51     2014-07-01 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes.

         - [Bugfix] Avoid Perl autovivification which cause an arg that has no
           schema to have a schema of [].


0.50     2014-06-29 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes.

         - Re-upload.


0.49     2014-06-29 (SHARYANTO)

         - shell_complete_args() allows completion routines to return hash
           (completion reply + metadata) instead of just array (completion
           reply) (Rinci 1.1.52).


0.48     2014-06-27 (SHARYANTO)

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - shell_complete_args() now returns hashref instead of plain arrayref,
           to return extra metadata to give hints to formatter (like
           Complete::Util's format_shell_completion()) on how to properly
           display/escape special characters to the shell. For example, if we're
           completing environment variables (type=>'env') we don't need to
           escape the dollar sign.


0.47     2014-06-26 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes.

         - [Bug fix] Remove perl undef warning when arg doesn't have schema.


0.46     2014-06-25 (SHARYANTO)

         - [Bug fix] Forgot to remove complete_array() in
           complete_arg_{val,elem}().


0.45     2014-06-25 (SHARYANTO)

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - No longer filter completion routine with complete_array(), it's now
           up to the routine to filter it, this allows case-insensitive matching
           or spelling correction.


0.44     2014-06-25 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes.

         - Use Complete::Util which replaces SHARYANTO::Complete::Util.


0.43     2014-06-19 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - [silly] complete_from_schema(): Do a digit-by-digit completion for
           float.


0.42     2014-06-19 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - [tweak] Don't switch to complete arg name when word starts with '-'
           but opt before word expects value. For example, '--bool -^' will
           switch to completing arg name, but '--str -^' will still try to
           complete str's value because it expects value.

         - [silly] complete_from_schema(): Do a digit-by-digit completion for
           int.


0.41     2014-06-19 (SHARYANTO)

         [BUG FIXES]

         - Fix completion of array argument's element ('--ary ^' not yet
           completed as element).


0.40     2014-06-19 (SHARYANTO)

         - Third attempt, only riap_server_url is needed, riap_uri is optional
           because the former can contain the latter.


0.39     2014-06-18 (SHARYANTO)

         - Second attempt, we also need riap_server_url.


0.38     2014-06-18 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add riap_client & riap_uri arguments to
           shell_complete_args,complete_arg_{val,elem} to allow requesting to
           server when completion/element_completion coderef has been cleansed
           into string (currently no tests yet).


0.37     2014-06-18 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Don't die if arg spec's completion is not a coderef, decline instead.


0.36     2013-11-14 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Implement argument element completion (Rinci 1.1.42).

         - Add functions: complete_arg_elem, complete_from_schema.

         [BUG FIXES]

         - complete_arg_val() now returns undef when it can't find completion
           from schema, so shell_complete_arg() can fallback to files.

         - Complete greedy argument names, always (allow us to complete e.g.
           --file F1 --file F2 etc).


0.35     2013-11-08 (SHARYANTO)

         [BUG FIXES]

         - No functional changes. Avoid CT failure reports by forcing
           Perinci::Sub::Wrapper version.


0.34     2013-11-05 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - shell_complete_arg(): Accept 'extra_completer_args' argument to pass
           to custom completion routines.

         - Pass 'parent_args' argument to all custom completion routines
           (previously only 'custom_completer' gets it, now
           'custom_arg_completer' and 'completion' arg spec also get it).

         - complete_arg_val(): observe 'is' clause.

         - complete_arg_val(): complete [0, 1] for bool type.

         [BUG FIXES]

         - A few bug fixes.


0.33     2013-11-04 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Allow 'custom_arg_completer' to decline with undef, just like
           'custom_completer'.

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - 'custom_arg_completer' is now expected to return arrayref instead of
           list, just like the other completion routines.


0.32     2013-11-04 (SHARYANTO)

         [REFACTORING]

         - Rename dist from Perinci-BashComplete to Perinci-Sub-Complete because
           I want to extract non-Perinci-related routines to another module and
           I want to support other shells (someday).

         - Split generic (non-Rinci/Riap-related) functions to
           SHARYANTO-Complete-Util.

         - Rename some functions.


0.31     2013-09-08 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Remove references to Perinci::Access::InProcess.


0.30     2013-08-10 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Allow other line parser to be used, e.g. one that doesn't call out to
           bash (currently undocumented).


0.30     2013-08-10 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Allow other line parser to be used, e.g. one that doesn't call out to
           bash (currently undocumented).


0.29     2012-06-22 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Support --dry-run for function which has dry_run feature


0.28     2012-03-22 (SHARYANTO)

         - Support with.dot function arguments

         - Normalize --foo_bar into --foo-bar


0.27     2012-03-16 (SHARYANTO)

         [FIXES]

         - file completion inserted "." on every file/dir on the current dir.

         - file completion cut intermediate dirs ("dir/a" completed into ["aa",
           "ab"] instead of ["dir/aa", "dir/ab"]

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add trick in dir completion so that a single "dir/" match won't cause
           bash to insert space after the "/".


0.26     2012-03-07 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Deal with test failure reports from CT (change
           'replace $HOME with ~' test in t/_line_to_argv.t into a warning, as I
           don't know the workaround yet).


0.25     2012-03-04 (SHARYANTO)

         [BUG FIXES]

         - More fixes to complete_file() so it more closely resembles bash
           (symlink traversal is still different though).


0.24     2012-03-04 (SHARYANTO)

         [BUG FIXES]

         - complete_file() now behaves more like bash (though not nearly
           so, due to glob()'s quirks): First it works with files/dirs outside
           curdir. When word is '' or ends with '/', it uses readdir() to
           include dotfiles. Otherwise it treats word as wildcard and glob() it.


0.23     2012-03-03 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Change implementation of _line_to_argv() from
           calling Perl binary and dumping @ARGV, to using bash's own "$@". On
           my Atom N570 netbook, this shaves time from about 0.1s to 0.03s.


0.22     2012-02-28 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Fix to avoid numerous CT failure reports
           (calling perl binary using $^X instead of the hardcoded "perl"). I
           haven't quoted $^X, hope that won't cause much trouble though.


0.21     2012-02-28 (SHARYANTO)

         - Handle argument name completion of one-letter args and cmdline_aliases.


0.20     2012-02-27 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Make _line_to_argv() report errors (lots of
           failure reports from CPAN Testers with apparently undef result from
           _line_to_argv()).


0.19     2012-02-23 (SHARYANTO)

         - Rename distribution from Sub-Spec-BashComplete to Perinci-BashComplete.
           Follow Rinci v1.1 specification.


0.18     2011-11-23 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. _parse_schema() moved from Data::Sah::Util to
           normalize_schema() in Data::Sah.


0.17     2011-10-31 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. _parse_schema() is moved from Sub::Spec::Utils
           to Data::Sah::Util.


0.16     2011-08-25 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Adjust to Sub::Spec 0.15.


0.15     2011-07-26 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Adjust to use the new Sub::Spec::GetArgs::Argv.


0.14     2011-05-31 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Skip tests on systems which don't have bash.


0.13     2011-02-23 (SHARYANTO)

         - Add missing dependency: Log::Any [CT].


0.12     2011-02-23 (SHARYANTO)

         - Add missing dependency: Sub::Spec::CmdLine [CT].


0.11     2011-02-22 (SHARYANTO)

         - Use Sub::Spec::Utils.


0.10     2011-02-19 (SHARYANTO)

         - Incompatible change: arg_complete & custom_completer now expected to
           return arrayref instead of list.

         - More fixes for remaining_words for custom_completer.


0.09     2011-02-18 (SHARYANTO)

         - Handle backspaced whitespace.

         - Don't escape output (let completer program do it) to avoid double
           escaping.

         - Fix cword & remaining_words for custom_completer.


0.08     2011-02-18 (SHARYANTO)

         - Backslash-escape output.

         - Spec: cmdline_aliases renamed to arg_aliases.


0.07     2011-02-17 (SHARYANTO)

         - bash_complete_spec_arg(): Also add --nofoo completion for bool
           cmdline_aliases.


0.06     2011-02-17 (SHARYANTO)

         - bash_complete_spec_arg(): Add 'custom_completer' option, parse
           'cmdline_aliases' in arg spec.


0.05     2011-02-17 (SHARYANTO)

         - Fix cword counting.


0.04     2011-02-16 (SHARYANTO)

         - Small fix on detecting arg name/value.


0.03     2011-02-16 (SHARYANTO)

         - Complete arg name instead of value if user type '-' (indicates he/she
           wants arg name).


0.02     2011-02-16 (SHARYANTO)

         - Fix dependency version (requires Sub::Spec::CmdLine 0.10+).


0.01     2011-02-16 (SHARYANTO)

         - First release.
