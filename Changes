Revision history for Perinci-BashComplete

0.24     2012-03-04

         + [Fix] complete_file() now behaves more like bash (though not nearly
         so, due to glob()'s quirks): First it works with files/dirs outside
         curdir. When word is '' or ends with '/', it uses readdir() to include
         dotfiles. Otherwise it treats word as wildcard and glob() it.


0.23     2012-03-03

         No functional changes. Change implementation of _line_to_argv() from
         calling Perl binary and dumping @ARGV, to using bash's own "$@". On my
         Atom N570 netbook, this shaves time from about 0.1s to 0.03s.


0.22     2012-02-28

         No functional changes. Fix to avoid numerous CT failure reports
         (calling perl binary using $^X instead of the hardcoded "perl"). I
         haven't quoted $^X, hope that won't cause much trouble though.


0.21     2012-02-28

         Handle argument name completion of one-letter args and cmdline_aliases.


0.20     2012-02-27

         No functional changes. Make _line_to_argv() report errors (lots of
         failure reports from CPAN Testers with apparently undef result from
         _line_to_argv()).


0.19     2012-02-23

         Rename distribution from Sub-Spec-BashComplete to Perinci-BashComplete.
         Follow Rinci v1.1 specification.


0.18     2011-11-23

         No functional changes. _parse_schema() moved from Data::Sah::Util to
         normalize_schema() in Data::Sah.


0.17     2011-10-31

         No functional changes. _parse_schema() is moved from Sub::Spec::Utils
         to Data::Sah::Util.


0.16     2011-08-25

         No functional changes. Adjust to Sub::Spec 0.15.


0.15     2011-07-26

         No functional changes. Adjust to use the new Sub::Spec::GetArgs::Argv.


0.14     2011-05-31

         No functional changes.

         [ETC]

0.10     2011-02-19

         Incompatible change: arg_complete & custom_completer now expected to
         return arrayref instead of list.

         More fixes for remaining_words for custom_completer.


0.09     2011-02-18

         Handle backspaced whitespace.

         Don't escape output (let completer program do it) to avoid double
         escaping.

         Fix cword & remaining_words for custom_completer.


0.08     2011-02-18

         Backslash-escape output.

         First release.
